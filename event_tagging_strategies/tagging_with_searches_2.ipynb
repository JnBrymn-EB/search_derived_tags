Cryptocurrency or 'cryptoasset' prices have dropped significantly from their all time highs in January 2018. The majority of new, ambitious traders and investors have been selling at record speeds. Meanwhile the experienced hedge fund managers and investors, including George Soros, are beginning to buy up all the underpriced cryptoassets that have recently hit new lows. The price manipulation worked. But the hype, hysteria and extreme volatility surrounding the price of Bitcoin, and other variations of this new and exciting asset class, have successfully opened up a number of great new buying opportunities for the attentive investor.                   Whilst opportunities for good investments in the crypto space have begun to appear, there is one barrier to that is stopping you from being able to successfully capitalise on this rare market sell-off. That barrier is a lack of understanding of the real world value of this new asset class.                    As Warren Buffet, the worlds most successful investor has said:          “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.” and \"risk comes from not knowing what you are doing\".                    The fundamentals to being able to work out the actual value of any cryptoasset are not as complex as it may seem, and our team have spent the best part of a year researching trends, behaviours and the mechanics of cryptoassets to bring you some of the most effective and reputed methods of investing and trading, from some of the greatest thinkers in the investing and cryptocurrency space.                   The impact of this seismic shift in economics will also be seen throughout the business world. From the impact of cryptocurrency and blockchain on equality, to its impacts on marketing and democratic voting systems. Very few industries will be left untouched.                    We will also be discussing the potential impacts of blockchain and cryptocurrency on the future of business and society.                   This will be the final workshop and session run by Blockchainers until September 2018.                   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                   TIMETABLE:                   - 6:00pm - Introduction to cryptoassets and the stock market                   - 6:15pm - Valuation models and best practices for cryptoasset investing                   - 6:45pm - Case studies and examples                   - 7:00pm - The future of blockchain   cryptocurrency in business                   - 7:20pm - Equality in this new industry                   - 7:30pm - End and networking                   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    ...\n",

Espaces d'échange     Et pour tous les moments d'échange entre les talks (accueil café, pauses, déjeuner sur place, et  social event ), ce ne sont pas moins de 3 halls comme celui ci-dessous que devops REX réquisitionne pour l'occasion ! Afin d'offrir aux visiteurs davantage de confort pour circuler et échanger avec nos sponsors, une salle supplémentaire de 200m 2 est aménagée au rez-de-chaussée.                Un espace privilégié : le salon VIP     Pour la première fois cette année, le 1 er étage sera transformé en salon VIP. Cet espace privé est réservé aux speakers, aux décideurs invités par les sponsors, et à nos meilleurs sponsors. Il sera le théâtre de rencontres exclusives et de moments d’échanges en toute discrétion, et vous permettra d’échapper un instant à l’effervescence des salons communs ! À l'intérieur, un service traiteur haut-de-gamme et un aménagement feutré favoriseront les échanges plus approfondis entre les visiteurs et les sponsors.     Attention , l'accès à la salle de conférence ainsi qu'aux espaces d'échange n'est malheureusement pas adapté aux personnes à mobilité réduite.

      "body=  In this 6th edition of Recruitment Hacks, we turn to the topic of referrals. We invite speakers and participants to discuss ways to turn talents into ambassadors and champions of the employer brand. Referrals are often the best and biggest recruitment channel. A well designed referral program is known to increase both the quality of the talent pool and the retention of the personnel, making it one of the most cost effective ways to hire. Engaging both employees and candidates to refer candidates is therefore a critical element of success in any talent acquisition. We explore the methods that work, and those that don t, and how they need to be adapted to the new generations.  \r",

His PhD focused on the links between the legal thought of four major Sufi figures from the 3rd/9th century until the 19th centuries, as well as the influence of their ideas on later revivalist movements in the 19th and 20th centuries.  He received his BA in Arab   Islamic Civilizations from the American University in Cairo, followed by an MA and PhD in the field of Islamic Studies from SOAS, University of London. He is the author of   Reassurance for the Seeker: A Biography and Translation of Salih al-Ja’fari’s al-Fawa’id al-Ja‘fariyya, a Commentary on Forty Prophetic Traditions   (Fons Vitae, 2013) and his upcoming works include   The Sufi’s and the Law: Ibn Arabi’s School of Mercy   (to be published), “The Centrality of Ibn Arabi in Popular Hadith Chains” (  Journal of the Muhyiddin Ibn Arabi Society  , November 2017) and   Sufi Hadith Commentaries and Their Impact on Classic Hadith Commentary Works   (to be published).

      "body=  Unlock creativity through intense mind altering, sober psychedelic experiences.       A licensed bodyworker will lead you through partner-based massage with high-energy beats, up-regulating breathwork, Taoist big draws, and awakening energy. Each set of paired individuals will explore what it means to be in their bodies while receiving one-directional touch from their partner. Participants leave feeling connection with their body, the healing power of touch, and a rejuvenating sense of release. And it’s fun!     Other benefits include:      Self-awareness   Communication skills   Coping with insecurities   Joyous mental state   Letting go in a safe space      This bodywork is not sexual, but it is potentially sensual. It is a chance to explore somatic embodied learning (gaining knowledge through physical sensation).             TIMING     Doors will open at 7pm and close promptly at 7:30pm to create a safe and closed container. We will strictly be enforcing this.     Intro: The event starts with a crucial consent, boundaries, and communication section at the beginning. Followed by time to connect with your partner.        Main section: Along with music, the instructor leads participants through energizing breathwork and basic movement. The receiver communicates how they would like to receive one- directional touch (direct sexual touch is not allowed). The instructor guides the giver and offers adjustments. After 35 minutes, we have a quick break and the partners switch roles.      Reflection: After both partners have given and received touch, the music and guided breathing slows. At the end of the course, the instructor allows time for a brief refection and savoring.     WHAT TO BRING     Because this is a clothing-optional event, bring your own towel or yoga mat to lie on (even better, bring both!). We also encourage you to bring additional objects of comfort, such as blankets and pillows.     CHOOSING A BUDDY     This workshop is partner-based. Tickets are sold as a pair. A partner can be your best friend, a lover or someone you're getting to know.     WHAT TO WEAR     You can be fully clothed or naked as when you were born. We encourage you to define your own boundaries, and be comfortable with others’ choices in the shared space. Past participants have found that the most comfortable clothing to wear is loose or stretchy material.          ...\n",

Our investments are about more than just money-- through our accelerator program, teams receive world-class coaching, personalized mentorship targeted at each company's specific needs, and access to our extensive network of investors and str ategic partners. The value that we provide to our portfolio companies is centered around services, not capital; we like to view the money we invest like financial aid for university students, covering necessary living expenses so founders can focus on taking their businesses to the next level. For this reason, although we occasionally make outside investments, most of our portfolio companies pass through our accelerator.   The goal of our 12-week program is to get each company ready to raise money on a larger scale. While we make important introductions to investors and potential acquirers in our network, we focus primarily on teaching founders how to craft a great pitch and how to close a deal when the time comes. Our strategic partners provide discounted accounting and legal services that help our teams protect their intellectual property, hire their first employees, and mediate disputes. Quake's multiple locations in NYC, L.A, and Austin, TX give our portfolio companies an impressive advantage when it comes to securing additional investment and becoming fast-growing, scalable, disruptive businesses.   ...\n",

You'll also find plenty of inspiration (in the form of some beautiful photos) to get back into photography if you haven't done it in a while. You get to ask any burning questions to a professional photographer. And it's a great way to spend an afternoon in the company of other beginners and amateurs. However, if you already have a good handle on things like shutter speed, aperture, ISO and manual mode, this class is probably going to be too basic for you. \r",

Every year, large amounts of non-biodegradable rubbish are dumped into the oceans, killing seabirds, whales, dolphins, seals, and other marine life, all around the world. Just like you would not want to live in a home filled with others' inconsiderate litter, a natural environment means a safer and healthier home for plants and animals.    Volunteers are invited to join us for a morning of cleaning the beach and helping to restore the natural beauty of our Singapore coastline! Thereafter, you're more than welcome to join us for our vegetarian barbecue lunch and a fun-filled afternoon of games and music as we hope to build and foster friendships amongst like-minded people.   As no cleanup tools will be provided, please do bring your own such as:   1) Plastic rubbish bags (at least 5) 2) Tongs (preferably long ones for picking up rubbish with ease) 3) Gloves (latex material is advised)   Please also ensure that you bring your own necessities (e.g. small backpack, wet tissues, mosquito repellant, water bottle, umbrella, poncho, and sunscreen). Do wear comfortable clothing, keeping our hot weather in mind.   Meeting point will be at Area B, BBQ Pit 1.

Fast forward 7 weeks we have not left each other once!!! All the times he was manifesting me, I was manifesting him. I had more from these past 7 weeks then any of my previous partners. He's loving, kind, gentle, beautiful human and we are so so so in love. There is something very divine around our connection and words are an understatement.

By the way, I am Raisa 27 white. We are conducting an upcoming orgy party in this area? If you are looking for GROUP of FUN. Come and join us. Or Email me here at ( R aisaturner28@gmail.com)      Orgy Party is open to anyone 21 years or older. All ages, races, religions and LGBTQ community warmly welcomed.  * Do you long for more touch, nurturing, or affection in your life? * Is it hard to find safe, non-sexual touch?  * Are you ready to explore conscious connection, authentic consent, and empowered boundaries?   Then a aorgy Party is the place for you! Come and experience the abundance of love and nurturing touch that is available to you. This is a GREAT place for beginners!!!       We are a recently established group of experienced and semi-experienced swingers who meet on a fairly regular basis at a number of locations in our member's area for group fun. It is a safe, comfortable and fun environment for all, You can be single, a couple or an existing group of swingers with experience or those new to the scene \"       It doesn't matter if you want to join in with a full sexual group experienced.       Play as a couple or just watch you will still be welcome and all personal boundaries are respected at all times. Some of us are straight, some bi, and some bi-curious so whatever you fancy getting in touch and we will consider you for our next meeting.   There’s no question about it ~ we all crave more touch. The body's bliss hormone, Oxytocin, is released by nurturing, welcome, consensual touch and is essential for the wellbeing of your body, your heart, and your spirit. Your nervous system, blood pressure, and emotional health all benefit from healthy, heart-full touch!   Safe touch also enhances your ability to connect with and trust people, your capacity to respect and care for yourself, your creativity, and your sense of safety, comfort, and belonging. Infants who are deprived of touch fail to thrive, and we never outgrow that need. In today’s high-tech low-touch society, we especially crave the authentic connection, deep listening, and nurturing touch that we were born to receive.   Though touch is natural, the skills that make it welcome and enjoyable sometimes need to be learned and practiced. Skills of communication, expressing boundaries, asking for what you want, and saying ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ with clarity and kindness.   At a Orgy Party you gain:  * Clarity and confidence about your wants and needs  * Boundary and communication skills  * Comfort, support and encouragement  * The secrets to welcome, relaxed, platonic touch  * Satisfying your pleasure.

Our teacher is going to talk about anatomy, lubrication, toys, analingus, fingering, penetration. If there’s something specific you want to discuss, bring it up. Anything you ever wanted to know about the BUTT.                   Cherry Noir 'Classic' is now day 2 of our new 2-Night Cherry Noir events. All the kinky and sexy swinger adventures you can handle. We have our non-gendered Thursdays and Cherry Noir 'Classic' on Fridays for select weekends throughout 2018. If you attend both days, you get a $5 discount off Friday's admisison*. There are two separate party pages for each night, so be sure to RSVP for the night(s) you want to attend. (      *$5 off discount on Friday is per couple, triad, or single man. Not valid with single lady admission since that is already vastly discounted.)  Come to our LGBTQ Thursday and RSVP at:  http://cherrynoir34.eventbrite.com          Please reserve your spot early and show up to the club before 11pm, to ensure admission. This is the longest running BDSM/Swinger event in the city and it's only getting better. So bring your friends and come out to a great event for dancing and BDSM.              Couples and Poly groups welcome!     APPROVED SINGLE MEN WELCOME ON FRIDAY NIGHTS!       Couples - $40 Triads - $60 Single Ladies - $15,  Single Men - $40      (M    UST RSVP TO GET DISCOUNTED RATE)          Must be 21 or over, BYOB, 6,000 sq. ft play space, Private rooms, Secured Parking Lot,  Dinner served           2533 Emery Street Philadelphia, PA 19125                 Check out the Cherry Noir FAQ for answers to many common questions.             General Event Description of Cherry Noir BDSM Parties:          Cherry Noir is a BDSM   Swingers play party held on select Thursday/Fridays (Back-to-back events) at the Saints and Sinners Swingers Club.  Truly an upscale and hip lounge environment, with an intimate vibe that encourages new experiences and meeting new people. Play publicly or in private. Party in a 6,000 sq. foot playspace.   Cherry Noir is proof that Kinksters and Swingers can come together in harmony for one heck of a good party!             Appropriate for newbies and experienced players age 21 and up. Cherry Noir events cater to couples, triads, and poly groups on Fridays, and open to all Kinksters on Thursdays with a particular emphasis in welcoming the LGBTQ crowd. Prices vary depending on the night, but range from $20/person non-gendered pricing on Thursdays with pre-paid admission or $30 at the door with RSVP only, to $40 per couple and $60 for Triads for Fridays.  Single folks have a different pricing structure so singles are encouraged to bring a friend, a lover, a date, a wingman, a companion, a bro, a compadre, an associate, a human-pet, a dominant, a submissive, a bff, a bosom buddy, a comrade, a confidante, a friend with benefits, a pal, a fet friend, etc. to come to the event with.  Check the particular event you're interested in attending for the correct pricing structure.               When you enter Cherry Noir for the first time, you might not notice the gorgeous cherry wood flooring or the murals of semi-nude beauties adorning the ceiling above the elevated seating area. But, you will notice the well crafted dungeon furniture, the clean and stylish couches, and the dance floor containing a stripper pole that will definitely get some action throughout the night. Directly to your right is the buffet and safety equipment tables.   Cherry Noir opens at 8pm on Thursday events, and 9pm on Friday. Dinner (or buffet nibbles on Thursdays) is already ready for you when you walk in.   The safety supplies include paper towels, bottled waters, Clorox wipes, band-aids, condoms, lubes, dental dams, nitrile gloves, a blanket, and a slew of other stuff nearby should you need anything. The entire nightclub feels posh and sleek with the main bar area adorned in a mood lighting that feels warm.         Mistress Zeneca has a host of people known as the   'Ambassadors of Love' identifiable by the large red heart badges and the glow sticks they wear.   These are the people who you can feel free to ask questions about the club, about the lifestyle, about skills, talents, etc. They secure scenes from intrusion and mingle around to make sure that everyone is having a good time. Ambassadors of Love can even make introductions or give you a person to hang with if you're on the shy side.  Their job is to make everyone feel comfortable and to make sure that everyone's safety and security are managed.   The Ambassadors of Love are an extension of Mistress Zeneca's hosting and each one displays the type of hospitality and warmth that she would like to extend personally to you.   If you have any issues, problems, or concerns, grab an Ambassador and the issue will be addressed. The club staff is also top notch and will handle anyone that steps out of line.         The music is loud and bumping, featuring a combination of dark electronica, electroclash, pop songs that are more on the sensually erotic side, DJ created mash-ups of rock songs, and danceable industrial songs. It's a good mix for dancing or for beating someone to. The DJ takes requests as well, so you can feel free to add your own flavor to the night.           Around 10:30pm or so, a class will open up on the quieter Mezzanine level. The teacher will teach some pre-arranged topic or have a discussion about what everyone would like to learn. It's always standing room only and very informative.          Usually by midnight, all around you are scenes of all sorts . People being sexually intimate with their partner(s), people in exquisite agony and ecstasy, and people trying out something new. Exhibitionists and voyeurs getting just what they came there for. Whatever you thought your night could be, it can be even better. The open minded vibe of the entire place just fosters that type of energy. The club stands by a NO means NO rule. So nothing is expected and   you can feel free to do nothing or everything, with your partner(s) or with someone new  . There is no pressure to ever engage with someone outside your relationship(s). Use the energy of the place to inspire you. The party ends at 2am on Thursdays and 3am on Fridays. Plenty of time to do whatever your heart desires.         Since Cherry Noir takes place at the Saints and Sinners nightclub, a BYOB establishment, you can bring whatever alcoholic beverage you'd like to drink for the night. Mixers, sodas, etc. are provided for free. Be sure to tip the bartenders. If you're drinking, we encourage you to partake lightly. The bartenders will stop serving someone that appears intoxicated.         There are 4 levels to the club: Locker room level with open shower area, Bedroom level with public and private bedrooms, Mezzanine level a quieter seating/play area with the second stripper pole, and the Main dance floor level. The levels are connected by staircases.  The club provides towel service and coat check.            Tips  :  Bring a lock for the locker room. Dress to impress or Dress to undress - Dress up to go out. No fire, scat, or guns. All messy play keep to the shower area and clean up after yourself. Keep your scenes clean and safe. Mind your sharps and dispose of anything with bodily fluids/blood appropriately.     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      Another awesome event from  http://www.ElegantlyKinky.com   Contact Mistress Zeneca with any questions - Fetlife.com username: ElegantlyKinky         ...\n",

      "body=  FOR THE COST OF ONE YOGA CLASS, YOU CAN CHANGE A LIFE.    In conjunction with International Yoga Day, join  Yoga Gives Back ambassador Wendy Chan  for a rejuvenating and energizing Friday Morning at the YOGA SEEDS GREEN ROOM to support a good cause.  This public holiday, f low with your breath and open your heart to all possibilities.   Practice is suitable for all levels.     *All proceeds will be donated to Yoga Gives Back     For enquiries, email recharge@yogaseeds.com.sg or WhatsApp/SMS 8322 1251.               About Yoga Gives Back          Our mission is to mobilize the global yoga community to empower women and children in India to build sustainable livelihoods.   Yoga Gives Back is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to raising awareness and funds in order to alleviate poverty in India. We started in Los Angeles in 2007, determined to find a way for the global yoga community to help the poorest people in the country that gave birth to YOGA. In 2014, the US yoga industry is reported to generate an astonishing 27 billion dollars and yoga's popularity continues to grow worldwide. If a fraction of this resource can be redirected to help the poorest people in India, we can make a lifetime difference!! Many charitable organizations have emerged from within the yoga community, but Yoga Gives Back is a very unique campaign which shows our gratitude by supporting impoverished mothers and children in India.    In 2007, inspired by Nobel Peace Prize Recipient Dr. Muhammad Yunus' revolutionary micro-financing breakthrough, Yoga Gives Back began supporting microcredit programs. Through the Grameen Foundation, we funded programs who lend small loans to women who are otherwise excluded from the conventional banking and financial systems. Today, YGB  partners with local NGOs NISHTHA in West Bengal and Deenbandhu Trust in Karnataka, funding nearly 900 mothers and children with micro-loan programs, education funds and scholarships for higher education with a minimum of a five-year commitment to each person.              About YGB Ambassador Wendy Chan (Singapore)              Founder and director of Yoga Seeds, yoga events, retreats, and training company based in Singapore, Wendy hosts regular yoga retreats in Asia. When she’s not travelling, she’s back home in Singapore, teaching in various settings, including corporate yoga classes, yoga for children, private yoga sessions, regular studio sessions and also community classes for the underprivileged. In fact, she teaches anywhere that she can unroll her mat! Wendy’s background and interest in eastern and western philosophy led her to explore and study the workings of the mind, body and subtle energies of the universe through meditation and yoga. Her style of yoga is a unique blend of Hatha, Vinyasa and Yin Yoga, with emphasis on the breath in both movement and stillness.   \"Yoga has given me so much in my life, and it’s only natural for me to want to be part of an initiative that gives back, especially to India, the birthplace of Yoga. Yoga Gives Back helps our sisters in India through education and opportunities for financial independence, which I believe will have a huge impact in the future of women in India. I’m very blessed and privileged to be an ambassador for YGB and I’m proud to be part of the efforts to support this cause.\" - Wendy ...\n",
